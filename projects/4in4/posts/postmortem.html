	<h1>Postmortem</h1>

	<p class="date">August 27, 2020</p>

	<p>So...where are Startups #3 and #4? I didn't do them. I quit the challenge, which is ironic given that one of my goals was to practice follow through. I guess that continues to be one of my weaknesses.</p>

	<p>I failed to make 4 startups. Technically, I failed the challenge. However, I don't consider the experience a failure.</p>

	<p>I <i>did</i> create 2 startups. While they were amateur and I question if they each merited spending a full month of my time, I learned a lot from them.</p>

	<h2>What went poorly</h2>

	<p>Finishing, of course. The results of the first two projects were discouraging, and my motivation dwindled as the months wore on. Eventually, I found something I believed to be a better use of my time and honestly felt relieved when I moved on.</p>

	<p>Fulfilling my vision. When I imagined these products, I thought of big picture ideas, and let the details stay blurry. Kind of like the way your brain remembers a picture. For example, with Backpackingcost, I got the math working easily, but had no idea how to turn it into a sleek, appealing site that looked professional. When imagining the site, I didn't give any thought to design. I assumed it would come automatically. When I arrived at the end of the month, and it looked terribly amateur, I was disappointed.</p>

	<p>There is a wonderful 2 minute video quote from radio personality Ira Glass, who describes "The Gap" as a period of time where what you make doesn't live up to your expectations. This resonated with me as I sat there stumped by how I could create such lousy products. Here is the video: </p>

	<h2>What went well</h2>

	<p>I learned a lot from the startups I created. They helped me to understand gaps in my expertise and aspects about my personality that make this type of work challenging. They also showed me I have a long way to go before I'm capable of creating anything worth people's time. That doesn't mean I can't get there, but I have some work to do.</p>

	<h2>One year later</h2>

	<p>I quit working on this challenge because I had an opportunity to make games again with my longtime friend Patrick. We collaborated on a game together after college in 2015-16. We were proud to finish that game, but it was a commercial failure, ultimately due to our lack of experience.</p>

	<p>We were pretty burnt out on games after Kitty Lander, but 3 years was enough time to lick our wounds and rekindle our interest in games. We were better prepared this time around, but it still wasn't enough. We fell into many of the same traps as last time (poor understanding of the market, no knowledge or desire to do marketing, limited art and design abilities) and found ourselves with another flop.</p>

	<p>I would consider this game to be the spiritual successor to Startups #1 and #2. It was another self-inflicted project, just larger.</p>

	<p>I never said it, but the implied understanding is that these startups could eventually generate some sort of income and merit further investment. After a year and a half of "working" on my own (read: making half-finished games and hobby projects) and not earning a dollar, I'm here to throw in the towel.</p>

	<p>It has been a humbling experience. I think this journey began with Kitty Lander. I was 23 years old, fresh out of school, and cocky as hell. I thought I was too good to work for the man. I wanted to take the shortcut. If all it took to be the next big indie developer was sitting down and making a game, then that's exactly what I was going to do!</p>

	<p>It never occurred to me that getting a job in the industry would have been a crash course in how to develop games successfully. I could have worked alongside people that have mastered making games. Some are smarter and more skilled at it than I ever hope to be. <i>And I would have been paid to be there.</i></p>

	<p>Now I sit here, nearly 5 years later, only to find out that the shortcut led nowhere. Now I must march back to where I started, years older with little to show for it. Ironically, taking a job would have been the shortcut. Even if I had worked 3 years in the industry, I would have had time to leave afterwards and create the games that I did (and they probably would have been a whole lot better too).</p>
