	<h1>Startup 1: Backpacking Cost</h1>

	<p class="date">March 25, 2019</p>

	<h3>Try it out: <a href="https://backpackingcost.com" class="main-link">backpackingcost.com</a></h3>

	<p>Backpacking Cost is a website that lets you quickly estimate what it would cost to go backpacking in various countries around the world. There are several options to customize the budget based on your preferences, such as if you prefer to sleep in hostel dorms or private rooms and how much you drink.</p>

	<p>Inspiration for the idea was simple: I spent 8 months backpacking around Asia last year and budgeting was always a concern. There are already countless resources online that can help you find travel costs just like Backpacking Cost can. But that usually involves digging through blog posts stuffed with irrelevant information and huge walls of text. You might not find the answer you're looking for until halfway through. And then the prices might be five years out of date. And what if you want to compare different countries, or see what the difference would be if you traveled more lavishly?</p>

	<p>I wanted to create something with accurate, recent data that got straight to the point: "What will I spend if I go backpacking in <span style="text-decoration: underline; white-space: pre;">              </span>?"</p>

	<p>Building Backpacking Cost was a journey, and I learned a lot. Here are some reflections on how it went.</p>

	<h2>What went well</h2>

	<p><b>Entering a crowded market.</b> As mentioned above, many sites similar to Backpacking Cost already exist. Before I wrote any code, I spent half a day studying those sites to see if there was room for one more. I didn't know how to answer that question, and decided to make one anyways, holding on to the excuse that this was an experiment in case I failed. I expected that when I showed people the site, they would say "isn't that just like X?", but they didn't.</p>

	<p><b>Finishing something.</b> Even though there are a hundred things I want to add or change on the site, it is in a finished state. It shows most of the popular countries for backpacking all over the world. The data is recent and provides an accurate estimate. The interface is something I am happy with. It can actually be useful for people now.</p>

	<h2>What went wrong</h2>

	<p><b>Distractions</b> I didn't have a set work schedule. I would just worked from when I woke up until my roommate got home from work, Monday through Friday. I averaged 4.4 hours each day that I worked (according to my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15-8x4sW-uoavm1vnRSpMeMu_wkJzCMIPQd4LJ8dWxOA/edit?usp=sharing">work log</a>). I could have done more. I took a week long road trip in the middle of the month and whenever my roommate had a day off work, I took it off too. I had nobody to hold me accountable. If I wanted to stop working and watch YouTube videos for the rest of the day there was no one to stop me.</p>

	<p><b>Motivation.</b> The project was full of ups and downs. When I finished the first version, I was incredibly disappointed. I always had a vision for it, but never worked out the details of what it would look like. It was not what I was hoping for. (<a href="https://carsonstauffer.github.io/old-backpacking-calculator/">See for yourself</a>).</p>
	<p>I thought about cutting my losses, and moving on to the next project. I wasn't sure if I would count it as startup #1 or just pretend it didn't happen. I was too embarrassed to show it to anyone other than some design critics on reddit who I told to "tear it apart". Their response was a turning point for me. Not only did they have good advice, but they didn't hate it as much as I thought they would. That motivated me to keep going and was the start of the second version.  I was still dissatisfied with version 2 but I was interested and excited about the project. It wasn't long before I got a new idea of how I wanted the site to look and the current version was born. I was enjoying myself so much while making this part that I was working up to 7 hours a day on it, even putting some time in on weekends. </p>

	<p><b>Getting users.</b> The few people who have used Backpacking Cost claimed to like it. This makes me think more people would like it, if only they knew it existed. I want to show more people, but am puzzled with how to do it. I became active in some relevant online communities before I even started the project, so that I would have people to share it with. This has been the only source of traffic to the site.</p>
	<p>Sharing Backpacking Cost with these communities provides a brief spike in traffic that dies in a couple days. To get consistent traffic, I need either of two things: links to my site from other popular sites, or a better ranking in search results. Ironically, the only way to achieve #2 is to achieve #1. So I need those links. But any website with a good reason to send readers to Backpacking Cost is likely one of its competitors. And why would they send readers from their own site to one of their competitors? Not going to happen.</p>

	<p><b>Monetization.</b> I started this project with no business model in mind. I just liked the idea. Partway through, I had to think of a way to monetize it, because it's supposed to be a business and all. I became an affiliate with Skyscanner and World Nomads Insurance (I also tried and failed with HostelWorld). As an affiliate I can advertise for them on my site and get a commission if any of my users purchase their products. However, I never even got around to putting their ads on my site. So my site isn't monetized at all. It costs me $10 a year to run and took a month of my time for nothing in return.</p>
