	<h1>I'm Launching 4 Startups in 4 Months</h1>

	<p class="date">February 16, 2019</p>

	<p>I've decided to take on a challenge: build a new startup every month for 4 months. This is not my idea. I'm blatantly stealing this from Pieter Levels's <a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/">12 Startups in 12 Months</a>.</p>

	<p>I know what you're thinking. "Why 4? That other guy did 12." The thing is...12 months is a long time. Also, Pieter never actually finished all 12, and I haven't seen any of his imitators do it either. It makes sense: aside from burning out, how are you supposed to support and maintain that many startups while still building more? </p>

	<p>To further make my life easier, I plan to keep my startups small. Real small. Each one will be given a month, but that's a maximum. If I finish in two weeks that's fine with me. For each cycle, I just need to build a tool or service that people might use and release it to the world. It doesn't need to be beautiful, or even complete. Just functional enough to prove whether it's worth putting more time into. </p>

	<p>If you're thinking that doesn't sound like a "startup", you're not alone. I don't think so either. I click-baited you. Pieter Levels explained the reasoning behind calling homemade products like this "startups" with a quote from entrepreneurial legend Eric Ries, and I'm just going to steal that too:</p>

	<p class="quote">"A startup is a human institution designed to deliver a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty."<br/><br/> - Eric Ries, <i>The Lean Startup</i></p>

	<p>It doesn't matter if you're working from an office in Silicon Valley paid for by venture capitalists or a desk in your garage. If you are creating something with no certain idea of how it will turn out or how you are going to do it, you have a startup.</p>

	<h2>Why???</h2>

	<p>I like creating things. I like it even more when other people find them useful. Unfortunately, I've always struggled with finishing my creations. And if I do finish something, I'm even worse at sharing it.</p>

	<p>I usually spend too much time reading, planning, learning, hoping to spot failures before they happen. I end up feeling anxious about all the things that could go wrong while also accomplishing nothing. It's time for a different approach.</p>

	<p>By rapidly planning, building, and launching one product after another, I will get lots of exposure to this whole process. In past projects, I spent too much time in the build phase, hoping I would succeed if I just built them better, only to be overwhelmed by the parts of the process I ignored and ultimately fail.</p>

	<p>I will surely fail more, but I am ok with this. My primary goal is to learn. I can handle the cost to my savings (and my pride). I will be doing everything online, armed only with my MacBook and a developer background. I won't need to lease physical space, stock inventory, or deal with employees. Building these startups will cost me little more than my time. If I live frugally, I have enough savings to do this for a while if I want.</p>

	<p>My creations may never find an audience. Some will really suck. I'm ok with this too. I'm going to build them anyways.</p>

	<p>Follow me to find out what it takes to launch a startup from idea to reality in a few short weeks!</p>

	<p>Also, give me your ideas. I could always use some great ideas.</p>
